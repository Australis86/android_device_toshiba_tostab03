OmniROM device tree for Toshiba AT100 THRiVE.

This is a work-in-progress and is not yet ready for use. The end goal is to support OmniROM 4.4.4 and 5.1 on the Thrive. The Cyanogenmod equivalents are not supported due to the fact that the Thrive has a non-neon Tegra 2 processor - OmniROM is the only one to keep support for this in its source through to Android 5.1.
